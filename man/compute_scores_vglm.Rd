\title{Compute Observation-Level Score Contributions for vglm}
\usage{
compute_scores_vglm(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted vglm object.}
}
\value{
An n x p matrix of score contributions, where n is the number of
observations and p is the number of parameters.
}
\description{
Internal function to compute the score (gradient of log-likelihood)
contributions for each observation in a vglm model.
}
\details{
The score for observation i is computed as:
\deqn{\psi_i = X_i' \cdot \frac{\partial \ell_i}{\partial \eta}}
where \eqn{X_i} is the portion of the VLM model matrix for observation i
(an M x p submatrix where M is the number of linear predictors), and
\eqn{\frac{\partial \ell_i}{\partial \eta}} is the derivative of the
log-likelihood with respect to the linear predictors for observation i.

The VLM (vector linear model) structure in VGAM means that for an ordinal
model with M cutpoints, each observation contributes M rows to the design
matrix. The score for each observation is computed by multiplying the
M x p design matrix portion by the M x 1 derivative vector.
