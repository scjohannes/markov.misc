\title{Calculate Jackknife Monte Carlo Standard Error}
\usage{
jackknife_mcse(estimates, statistic = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimates}{Numeric vector of estimates from simulation runs.}

\item{statistic}{A function to apply to the estimates (default: mean).
Should accept a numeric vector and return a single numeric value.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the jackknife MCSE.
}
\description{
Computes the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) of a statistic using the
jackknife method. This provides an estimate of the variability in the
statistic across simulation repetitions.
}
\details{
The jackknife MCSE is calculated by:
\enumerate{
\item Creating leave-one-out estimates by removing each simulation run in turn
\item Calculating the statistic on the remaining runs
\item Computing the variance of these leave-one-out estimates
\item Applying the jackknife variance formula: sqrt(((n-1)/n) * sum((x_i - mean)^2))
}

This method is useful for assessing the Monte Carlo uncertainty in simulation
studies and can be applied to various statistics beyond the mean.

\examples{
# Calculate MCSE for mean of simulation estimates
sim_results <- rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 2)
mcse_mean <- jackknife_mcse(sim_results)

# Calculate MCSE for median
mcse_median <- jackknife_mcse(sim_results, statistic = median)
