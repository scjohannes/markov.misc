\title{Convert State Trajectory Data to Time-to-event data}
\usage{
states_to_tte_old(data, covariates = c("age", "sofa"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing trajectory data, typically the output from
\code{sim_trajectories_markov()} or \code{sim_trajectories_brownian()}. Must contain
columns: \code{id}, \code{time}, \code{y} (state), and \code{tx} (treatment).}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of additional covariate names to include in
the output (default: c("age", "sofa")). The first value of each covariate
per patient will be retained.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item id: patient identifier
\item tx: treatment assignment
\item start: start of the interval, first value per participant is zero
\item stop: end of the interval
\item y: state at the end of the interval
\item any additional covariates specified
}
}
\description{
This function calculates time-to-event for usage in Cox or recurrent event
models.
}
\details{
Each event change within a participant concludes a time interval indicated by
start and stop and the state at the end of the interval. Columns given in
covariates will be kept in the output.
