\title{Simulate Patient Trajectories Using Brownian Motion Latent Ordinal Model}
\usage{
sim_trajectories_brownian(
  n_patients = 1000,
  follow_up_time = 60,
  n_states = 6,
  mu_drift = -0.18,
  mu_treatment_effect = 0,
  sigma_rw = 0.12,
  x0_sd = 1,
  thresholds = c(-3.5, 0, 1, 3, 4.5),

}
\arguments{
\item{n_patients}{Integer. Number of patients to simulate (default: 1000).}

\item{follow_up_time}{Integer. Number of days to simulate per patient (default: 60).}

\item{n_states}{Integer. Number of ordered states/categories (default: 6).}

\item{mu_drift}{Numeric. Baseline drift per day for control group (default: -0.18).
Negative values indicate improvement (movement toward lower severity).}

\item{mu_treatment_effect}{Numeric. Additional drift for treatment group
(default: 0). Negative values indicate faster improvement with treatment.}

\item{sigma_rw}{Numeric. Random walk innovation standard deviation per day
(default: 0.12). Lower values create stronger autocorrelation.}

\item{x0_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation for baseline latent severity
(default: 1.0).}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of K-1 cutpoints for the ordered model
(default: c(-3.5, 0, 1, 3, 4.5) for 6 states). Higher values
represent more severe states.}

\item{treatment_prob}{Numeric. Probability of assignment to treatment group
(default: 0.5).}

\item{absorbing_state}{Integer or NULL. State number that represents death or other
absorbing state (default: 6). Once entered, patients remain there.
Set to NULL if no absorbing state is desired.}

\item{drift_change_times}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying when drift
begins to decline and when it reaches zero (default: c(25, 50)).
Drift is constant until first time, then linearly declines to 0 by second time.}

\item{latent_dist}{Character. The distribution used to link the latent variable
to observed states. Options are "logistic" (default) or "normal".
"logistic" uses the standard logistic CDF (plogis), while "normal" uses
the standard normal CDF (pnorm).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (default: NULL).}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with columns:
\itemize{
\item id: patient identifier
\item time: time/day (1 to follow_up_time)
\item tx: treatment assignment (0 = control, 1 = treatment)
\item y: observed ordinal state at time
\item x: latent continuous severity (NA after entering absorbing state)
}
}
\description{
Generates individual patient trajectories based on a latent continuous severity
variable that evolves as a Gaussian random walk (Brownian motion) with drift.
Observed states are determined by thresholding the latent variable using an
ordered logistic or ordered probit model.
}
\details{
This function implements a latent variable model where:
\enumerate{
\item Each patient has an unobserved continuous "severity" X(t) that evolves
as a Gaussian random walk: X(t) = X(t-1) + μ(t) + ε, where ε ~ N(0, σ²)
\item The drift μ(t) depends on treatment assignment and time
\item Observed states Y(t) are generated by thresholding X(t).
If \code{latent_dist = "logistic"}, P(Y ≤ k) = logit⁻¹(c_k - X).
If \code{latent_dist = "normal"}, P(Y ≤ k) = Φ(c_k - X).
\item Once a patient enters the absorbing state (death), they remain there.

# Standard Logistic model

# Probit model which approximates viral respiratory trajectories okay-ishly
# Because standard normal is narrower than logistic, thresholds need to be closer together, drift smaller, varaince lower etc.
