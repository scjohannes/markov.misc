\title{Compute time in target state(s) for treatment groups}
\usage{
taooh(
  model,
  data = NULL,
  times = NULL,
  ylevels = 1:6,
  absorb = 6,
  target_states = 1,
  varnames = list(tvarname = "time", pvarname = "yprev", id = "id", tx = "tx")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object from \code{rms::orm} or \code{VGAM::vglm}.
The model is used as-is without refitting.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing patient trajectory data. If NULL, attempts
to extract data from the model object (requires model fitted with
\code{x = TRUE, y = TRUE}).}

\item{times}{Time points in the data. Default is \code{1:max(data[["time"]])}}

\item{ylevels}{States in the data (e.g., 1:6)}

\item{absorb}{Absorbing state (e.g., 6 for death)}

\item{target_states}{Integer vector of target state(s) to calculate time in.
Default is 1 (typically "home" or baseline state). Can specify multiple
states, e.g., c(1, 2) to sum time across states 1 and 2.}

\item{varnames}{List of variable names in the data with components:
\itemize{
\item tvarname: time variable name (default "time")
\item pvarname: previous state variable name (default "yprev")
\item id: patient identifier (default "id")
\item tx: treatment indicator (default "tx")
}}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with three elements:
\itemize{
\item delta_taooh: difference in time in target state(s) (treatment - control)
\item SOP_tx: expected time in target state(s) for treatment group
\item SOP_ctrl: expected time in target state(s) for control group
}
}
\description{
Calculates the expected time spent in specified target state(s) for treatment
and control groups using a proportional odds Markov model. Uses an existing
fitted model and state occupancy probabilities to estimate the total time in
the target state(s).
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Takes a pre-fitted model (no refitting occurs in this function)
\item Computes state occupancy probabilities for each individual at each time point
\item Sums probabilities across target states and time points
\item Averages within treatment groups to get expected time in target state(s)
}

This function assumes the model has already been fitted on the appropriate
data. For bootstrap inference, see \code{\link{taooh_bootstrap}}, which handles
model refitting for each bootstrap sample.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit initial model
d <- rms::datadist(my_data)
options(datadist = "d")
m <- orm(y ~ tx + yprev + time, data = my_data, x = TRUE, y = TRUE)

# Calculate time at home (state 1) for a dataset
result <- taooh(
  model = m,
  data = my_data,
  ylevels = 1:6,
  absorb = 6,
  target_states = 1
)

# Calculate time in states 1 or 2 combined
result <- taooh(
  model = m,
  data = my_data,
  target_states = c(1, 2)
)
