\usage{
taooh_bootstrap(
  model,
  data,
  n_boot,
  workers = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  ylevels = as.character(1:6),
  absorb = 6,
  times = NULL,
  target_states = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object from \code{rms::orm} or \code{VGAM::vglm}.
For \code{orm}, should be fitted with \code{x = TRUE, y = TRUE} to enable
model updating with bootstrap samples.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the patient data}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap samples}

\item{workers}{Number of workers used for parallelization. Default is
parallel::detectCores() - 1}

\item{parallel}{Whether parallelization should be used (default FALSE)}

\item{ylevels}{States in the data}

\item{absorb}{Absorbing state}

\item{times}{Time points in the data. Default is \code{1:max(data[["time"]])}}

\item{target_states}{Integer vector of target state(s) to calculate time in.
Default is 1 (typically "home" or baseline state). Can specify multiple
states, e.g., c(1, 2) to sum time across states 1 and 2.}

\item{varnames}{List of variable names in the data}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\itemize{
\item id: Bootstrap iteration identifier (e.g., "Bootstrap01", "Bootstrap02", ...)
\item models: List column containing the bootstrap estimates of time in target state(s)
}
}
\description{
Performs fast group bootstrap resampling and computes confidence intervals for
the time spent in specified target state(s). Uses a custom fast bootstrap
implementation that is dramatically faster than rsample::group_bootstraps()
when working with many groups (e.g., >500 patients).
}
\details{
Uses fast group bootstrap resampling (resampling by patient ID) to preserve
the within-patient correlation structure. This implementation uses a
memory-efficient just-in-time (JIT) approach that is dramatically faster and
more scalable than rsample::group_bootstraps() for datasets with many groups.
Memory usage scales with number of groups (not rows), making it feasible to
bootstrap large datasets (e.g., 250k rows, 1000 groups, 2000 bootstraps).
See GitHub issue tidymodels/rsample#357 for details on the rsample performance issues.

For each bootstrap iteration:
\enumerate{
\item Samples patient IDs with replacement using \code{\link{fast_group_bootstrap}}
\item Creates unique IDs for resampled patients (e.g., "P001_1", "P001_2")
\item Checks which states are present and relevels factors to consecutive integers
\item Adjusts \code{ylevels} and \code{absorb} parameters if states are missing
\item Updates the datadist in the global environment (safe with future.callr)
\item Refits the model using \code{update()} with the bootstrap sample
\item Passes the refitted model to \code{\link{taooh}} to calculate the estimand
}

\strong{Handling missing states:} When certain states are absent from a
bootstrap sample (e.g., if state 3 is missing), the function automatically:
\itemize{
\item Relevels \code{y} and \code{yprev} to consecutive integers (1, 2, 4, 5, 6 becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
\item Updates \code{ylevels} to the new consecutive sequence
\item Adjusts the \code{absorb} parameter to the new position of the absorbing state
}
This prevents model fitting failures while maintaining the ordinal structure.

Parallelization is handled via future.callr::callr strategy, which provides
isolated R processes for each worker, making it safe to modify the global
environment (for datadist) without conflicts.

\strong{Important:} The \code{yprev} variable should be a factor before
fitting the model for proper handling of state levels.
